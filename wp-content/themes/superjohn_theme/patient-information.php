								<h2>Office Personnel</h2>
								<p>Providing health care is a team effort. We have hired an excellent office staff in order to meet your needs and to assist us in providing the highest quality of health care. The office staff will be glad to assist you in any way that they can. If you have any comments regarding the quality of health care provided to you by our physicians or your treatment by the office staff, we would appreciate hearing from you by letter or in person. </p>
								<br />
								<h2>Appointments &amp; Cancellations</h2>
								<p>An attempt is made to schedule an appointment at the earliest convenient time for each patient. The seriousness of the problem will be considered in making your appointment.</p>
								<p>If you are unable to keep your appointment, we require patients to notify us of cancellation at least 24 hours prior to the visit. This will allow another patient to be seen at an earlier time. We realize the importance of your time and make every effort to honor our time commitments. However, there will be times when there will be delays in the appointment schedule due to emergencies, delays in surgery or complex illnesses which require additional time to discuss with that patient. We will do our best to keep you informed of any necessary changes in the schedule. Your patience and cooperation are greatly appreciated. At the time of your appointment, you will also be given the appropriate attention and time required to meet your needs.</p>

								<br />
								<h2>Billing &amp; Insurance</h2>
								<p>We believe that our fees are reasonable and comparable to other urologists in the Los Angeles area. We are          participating in Medicare and are also members of various insurance plans and several PPOs and HMOs. If your insurance requires special pre-authorization, please make those arrangements with the receptionist before your visit. We bill directly those insurance companies with whom we have contracted and we will also bill any supplemental insurance that you may have. Insurance does not always pay the full amount due. In those cases, the patient is responsible for the co-pay amount at the time of the visit.</p>
								<p>Laboratory tests and tissue samples are usually sent to an independent laboratory who will bill you directly. If your insurance requires that we use a certain laboratory, please tell the receptionist or the doctor.</p>
								<p>Most questions regarding your insurance can be answered by our receptionist. We also have specialists in          insurance billing who are available to you Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.</p>
								<br />

								<h2>Communication with our Doctors</h2>
								<p>We encourage you to ask questions of the doctors if anything about your diagnosis or treatment is unclear. The          doctors are more than willing to discuss alternatives to our proposed therapy and we encourage second opinions whenever requested. You are encouraged to call or ask if you have any problems or questions regarding medications or pre- or post-operative instructions.</p>
								<p>A personal report will be sent to the physician who referred you to the group. This report will describe in detail the findings of your examination, your test results, and our recommendations.</p>
								<p>You will have your own doctor, but on nights and weekends another doctor in the group may treat you. All of our doctors do consult with each other to optimize your care.</p>
